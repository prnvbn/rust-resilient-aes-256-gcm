# Resilient AES 256 GCM decryption


This is a packet loss resilient AES 256 GCM decryption. 

I worked on a decryption problem which simple (almost trivial) to begin with but became more interesting when I tried to make it resilient to some packet loss.

I have re implemented my solution for this problem and go over it in my blog post here - https://prnvbn.github.io/posts/rust-aes-256/
